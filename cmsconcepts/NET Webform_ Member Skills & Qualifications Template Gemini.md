### User

I have a aspx .net 4.8.1 webform with c# and Bootstrap 5 

I have a members_all table and the members has an occupation, skill and qualifications. I need a template per memberID to control these

I suggest a MememberCapabilities tables with there memberid, ,the type of skill and a ranking of 1-10 per skill, also paid for skill or non paid. And a column for their offer to the church for probona.

We need to have categories for 0ccupation/Skills/Qualifications/Level of qualification (like Matric/diploma/degree)

Then unemployed as a cat.

each must be ranked.

the members are in members_all.memberid and we will then have a skills table and memberskill join, with date ranges and if active, archived

Right, Lee-Anne, that sounds like a sensible way to structure the information! Breaking down members' capabilities into categories like Occupation, Skills, and Qualifications, and then tracking them individually with rankings and status (like paid/unpaid skills or active/archived entries) will give you a great deal of flexibility.

Based on your suggestions and the need for categorisation, here's a proposed database schema structure that builds on your ideas:

We'll use a few tables to keep the data organised and maintain relationships correctly.

1.  **`members_all`**
    *   This table already exists and contains your core member information, including `memberid`. This will be the central table that the others link back to.
        ```sql
        -- Example structure, assuming this exists
        CREATE TABLE members_all (
            memberid INT PRIMARY KEY,
            -- ... other member fields ...
        );
        ```

2.  **`CapabilityCategory`**
    *   This table will define the broad types of capabilities.
    *   Examples: 'Occupation', 'Skill', 'Qualification', 'Qualification Level', 'Pro Bono Offer'.
        ```sql
        CREATE TABLE CapabilityCategory (
            CategoryID INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
            CategoryName NVARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE
        );
        ```
    *   *Initial Data Examples:*
        ```sql
        INSERT INTO CapabilityCategory (CategoryName) VALUES
        ('Occupation'),
        ('Skill'),
        ('Qualification'),
        ('Qualification Level'),
        ('Pro Bono Offer');
        ```

3.  **`Capability`**
    *   This table will hold the specific capabilities within each category.
    *   Examples: 'Carpenter' (under Occupation), 'SQL' (under Skill), 'Matric' (under Qualification), 'Degree' (under Qualification Level), 'Website Design' (under Skill, potentially linked to 'Pro Bono Offer' via `MemberCapability`). You could also have a 'CapabilityName' like 'Unemployed' linked to the 'Occupation' category here.
        ```sql
        CREATE TABLE Capability (
            CapabilityID INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
            CategoryID INT NOT NULL,
            CapabilityName NVARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
            -- Optional: Description NVARCHAR(MAX) NULL,
            CONSTRAINT FK_Capability_Category FOREIGN KEY (CategoryID)
                REFERENCES CapabilityCategory (CategoryID)
        );
        ```
    *   *Initial Data Examples (after populating `CapabilityCategory`):*
        ```sql
        -- Assuming CategoryID 1 is 'Occupation', 2 is 'Skill', 3 is 'Qualification', 4 is 'Qualification Level'
        INSERT INTO Capability (CategoryID, CapabilityName) VALUES
        (1, 'Unemployed'),
        (1, 'Carpenter'),
        (1, 'Teacher'),
        (2, 'SQL'),
        (2, 'Project Management'),
        (3, 'Matric'),
        (3, 'Diploma'),
        (3, 'Degree'),
        (4, 'NQF Level 4'), -- Matric
        (4, 'NQF Level 6'), -- Diploma
        (4, 'NQF Level 7'); -- Degree
        -- You'd add more specific skills, qualifications, etc.
        ```

4.  **`MemberCapability`**
    *   This is the join table that links members (`members_all`) to specific capabilities (`Capability`) and includes details specific to that member's relationship with that capability.
    *   This table incorporates the ranking, paid status, pro bono offer details, date ranges, and active status you mentioned.
        ```sql
        CREATE TABLE MemberCapability (
            MemberCapabilityID INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
            MemberID INT NOT NULL,
            CapabilityID INT NOT NULL,
            Ranking INT NULL CHECK (Ranking >= 1 AND Ranking <= 10), -- Optional, specifically for skills (1-10)
            IsPaidSkill BIT NULL, -- Optional, TRUE/FALSE for skills
            ProBonoOfferDetails NVARCHAR(MAX) NULL, -- Text details for a Pro Bono offer entry
            StartDate DATE NULL, -- When the member gained/was active in this capability
            EndDate DATE NULL, -- When the member stopped being active in this capability
            IsActive BIT NOT NULL DEFAULT 1, -- 1 for Active, 0 for Archived/Inactive
            DateAdded DATETIME NOT NULL DEFAULT GETDATE(),
            DateModified DATETIME NULL,
            CONSTRAINT FK_MemberCapability_Member FOREIGN KEY (MemberID)
                REFERENCES members_all (memberid),
            CONSTRAINT FK_MemberCapability_Capability FOREIGN KEY (CapabilityID)
                REFERENCES Capability (CapabilityID)
        );
        ```

**How this structure addresses your points:**

*   **Template per MemberID:** By querying the `MemberCapability` table filtering by `MemberID`, you can retrieve all capabilities linked to a specific member. Your Web Form page for a member would fetch and display these entries, effectively creating their capability "template".
*   **Categories:** The `CapabilityCategory` and `Capability` tables provide a structured way to define and categorise all possible occupations, skills, qualifications, and levels.
*   **Ranking:** The `Ranking` column in `MemberCapability` allows for scoring skills (1-10) as you requested. It's nullable, as not all capabilities (like qualifications) will have a ranking.
*   **Paid/Non-Paid:** The `IsPaidSkill` column handles this for skills. It's also nullable, only applicable where relevant.
*   **Pro Bono Offer:** You can have a `CapabilityCategory` called 'Pro Bono Offer'. Specific types of pro bono offers (e.g., 'Website Design', 'Gardening Help') could be entries in the `Capability` table linked to this category. The `ProBonoOfferDetails` field in `MemberCapability` allows the member to add specific text details for that particular offer.
*   **Unemployed:** Create a `Capability` entry called 'Unemployed' under the 'Occupation' category. A member can then link to this capability in `MemberCapability` and mark it as `IsActive=TRUE`.
*   **Date Ranges and Active/Archived:** The `StartDate`, `EndDate`, and `IsActive` columns in `MemberCapability` allow you to track the timeline and current status of each specific capability entry for a member.

**Web Forms Implementation (`.aspx` and C#):**

On your ASP.NET Web Form page for a member:

1.  Fetch the `MemberID` (e.g., from the URL or a session variable).
2.  Query the `MemberCapability` table, joining with `Capability` and `CapabilityCategory`, filtering by the `MemberID`.
3.  Group the results by `CategoryName` (`Occupation`, `Skill`, `Qualification`, etc.).
4.  Display the list of capabilities under each category for the member. You could use Bootstrap Cards, Accordions, or just structured `<div>` elements.
5.  For adding/editing capabilities, you would have a form:
    *   Dropdowns bound to the `CapabilityCategory` and `Capability` tables. The `Capability` dropdown would dynamically update based on the selected category using JavaScript or an UpdatePanel.
    *   Input fields for `Ranking`, `IsPaidSkill`, `ProBonoOfferDetails`, `StartDate`, `EndDate`. These fields could be conditionally shown/hidden based on the selected `CapabilityCategory` or `Capability` type.
    *   A checkbox for `IsActive`.
    *   Buttons to Save (Insert/Update `MemberCapability`) or Delete.

This structure provides a clear, normalised way to manage member capabilities and should integrate well with your existing .NET 4.8.1 Web Forms application and Bootstrap 5 styling. Good luck with the implementation! Let me know if you have more questions.
